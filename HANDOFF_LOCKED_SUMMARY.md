# Handoff Document Locking - Completion Summary

**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Task:** Lock architecture decisions in handoff document  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Time Taken:** ~30 minutes

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Status Updated ✅

**Before:**
```markdown
**Status:** 🎯 Planning Phase - Ready for Discussion
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Status:** 🔒 LOCKED - Ready for Implementation
**Design Locked:** November 2, 2025
**Implementation Progress:** ~75% complete (Phase 1 + 2a done)
```

---

### 2. All Architecture Questions Answered ✅

**11 decisions locked** based on implementation in `Canvas/` repository:

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Scope** | React-first with isolated core | Pragmatic MVP, can evolve later |
| 2 | **Rendering** | Layout engine only | Maximum flexibility, no renderer deps |
| 3 | **Components** | User implements all | Domain-specific, keeps package focused |
| 4 | **Templates** | TypeScript (JSON later) | Type-safe, can add JSON support later |
| 5 | **Edit Mode** | Provide hooks only | Reusable logic, UI is app-specific |
| 6 | **Font Loading** | Include utilities | Critical for accuracy, small footprint |
| 7 | **Exports** | HTML export included | Lightweight, users extend for PDF/PNG |
| 8 | **Measurement** | ResizeObserver only | Standard, SSR support later |
| 9 | **Package Name** | `@dungeonmind/canvas` | Short, memorable, available |
| 10 | **License** | MIT (open) | Encourages adoption, can restrict later |
| 11 | **Documentation** | README + examples | Sufficient for MVP, docs site later |

**Key Innovation:** Adapter Pattern for domain-specific logic (detailed below)

---

### 3. Adapter Pattern Section Added ✅

**New section:** "🔧 Adapter Pattern (Core Innovation)"

**Defines 5 adapter interfaces:**
1. **DataResolver** - Resolves data references from sources
2. **ListNormalizer** - Normalizes list items
3. **RegionContentFactory** - Creates region-specific content
4. **HeightEstimator** - Estimates component heights
5. **MetadataExtractor** - Extracts metadata for export

**Benefits documented:**
- ✅ Canvas has ZERO statblock dependencies
- ✅ Applications provide domain knowledge
- ✅ Easy to test with mocks
- ✅ Supports any document type

**Implementation status tracked:**
- ✅ Interfaces defined
- ✅ Default implementations created
- ✅ Exported from package
- 🚧 Canvas functions need adapter params (next step)

---

### 4. Empirical Success Criteria Added ✅

**Replaced vague criteria with testable evidence:**

**Before:**
```markdown
- [ ] Can register custom components in new project
- [ ] Can build page documents from templates + live data
```

**After:**
```markdown
- [ ] ZERO statblock imports in Canvas code
  - **Test:** `grep -r "StatBlockDetails|Action" Canvas/src/` returns 0 results
- [ ] 100% test pass rate (currently 95.5%, 42/44)
  - **Test:** `cd Canvas && npm test` shows 44/44 passing
- [ ] Package builds without errors
  - **Test:** `cd Canvas && npm run build` produces `dist/` output
```

**Added evidence requirements:**
- Specific commands to run
- Expected output
- Pass/fail criteria

**Split into phases:**
- Phase 2b: Canvas Genericization
- Phase 3: LandingPage Integration
- Phase 4: MVP Complete
- Future Success (Phase 5+)

---

### 5. Implementation Status Section Added ✅

**New section:** "✅ Implementation Status"

**Shows current progress:**
- ✅ Completed (Phase 1 + 2a) - ~75%
  - Repository setup
  - Core extraction
  - Adapter infrastructure
  - Test results: 42/44 passing (95.5%)

- 🚧 Remaining (Phase 2b-3) - ~25%
  - Canvas genericization (6-8 hours)
  - Statblock adapters (4-6 hours)
